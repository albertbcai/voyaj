Can you give me a summary of everything that I've done since my last commit to Git? And then, can you commit changes and then merge them. And then most importantly, can you make sure to log the most important todos to continue working on what I have been working on, based on the session here, so that I can pick up effectively from where I left off. Please ask me questions for clarification if you're not sure.
